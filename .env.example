# Example environment variables file
# Copy this file to .env.local and fill in your actual values
#
# Note: In this Vike project:
# - Both client and server use import.meta.env.*
# - Variables with PUBLIC_ENV__ prefix are accessible from client
# - Variables without prefix are server-side only

# ===== PUBLIC VARIABLES (accessible from client and server) =====

# Thirdweb Client ID (can be public)
PUBLIC_ENV__CLIENT_ID=your_thirdweb_client_id_here

# Chain ID (1329 = Sei Network)  
PUBLIC_ENV__CHAIN_ID=1329

# Game Points contract address on the blockchain
PUBLIC_ENV__GAME_POINT_ADDRESS=game_point_address

# ===== PRIVATE VARIABLES (server-side only) =====

# Private key for signing transactions (KEEP THIS SECRET!)
# This should be the private key of your signing wallet
SIGNER_SECRET_KEY=your_private_key_here_without_quotes

# Thirdweb secret key for server operations
THIRDWEB_SECRET_KEY=your_thirdweb_secret_key_here

# ===== SIGNATURE EXPIRE TIMES (in milliseconds) =====

# Default expire time for regular signature verification 
# 300000 = 5 minutes (used for /api/verify-signature)
SIGNATURE_EXPIRE_TIME_MILLI=300000

# Extended expire time for API calls
# 36000000 = 10 hours (used for /api/sign-action)
# Longer time allows users to perform game actions without frequent re-authentication
SIGNATURE_EXPIRE_API_TIME_MILLI=36000000
